# Demand Forecasting Application  

This project is focused on building a **forecasting application** that predicts future demand for small-scale stores.  
The application is developed as part of my graduate-level training in **Computer Science**, applying concepts from **machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data science**.  

The goal of this project is to explore different forecasting approaches, work with both public domain and synthetic datasets, and document the process of designing, testing, and improving predictive models.  
The application will include **data preprocessing, model experimentation, and visualization of results**, serving as a foundation for further enhancements in forecasting accuracy and usability.
